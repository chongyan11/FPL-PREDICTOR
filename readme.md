## README 
This is an experimental repo for a personal project. 

Objective / Motivation: Creating an FPL predictor that shows the optimal team to play each week. Based on fixture list, current team selected, wildcard option etc, form of players etc. 
Method:
1. Collect/update data weekly automatically
2. Machine learning (which algorithm?) for data and building a predictor based on factors deemed important
3. Based on model, generate list of all players and points they are likely to earn (with probability of appearance/mins?)
4. Feed list into optimisation program, feed current list of players - output new list of players based on game's constraints
